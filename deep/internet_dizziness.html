    <h1>Internet Dizziness</h1>
    <p>Tuesday 21/11/2023, Lahti</p>

    <p>I have been cutting off the internet from my home.<br>

    This is a conscious decision, not for financial reasons - because I’m a student, and my student apartment comes with free internet access.<br>
    I did this because I have been noticing that I could not get anything done when I have the Net at home. Even when I don’t have any actual work to do, I still did nothing besides from turning my brain off completely by surfing through meaningless websites.</p>
    <p>Since the day I made the decision of no internet at home, I have been replacing it with reading.<br>
    I did all of my work that requires the internet at either the campus or at the public library. With all of the work for the day done at those public places, I then check and reply to my messages (if I had any) and went home.</p>
    <p>I understand that I cannot be alerted with new messages when they usually come at evening times, which is the time where most people finished their work and have free time to send their messages. Those messages will be answered the day after when I have access to the public internet connection again, so I have said to myself.<br>
    That leave nothing else that requires the internet in my downtime.</p>
    <p>I then usually go home, make and eat my food, then start reading until my bedtime.<br>
    Sometimes I went for a long walk or cycling session, which is where I let my mind wanders around my relationships, studies, goals, and the things I have been reading about.</p>
    <p>I have been feeling calmer for the last two months of doing this.<br>
    My breathing has became slower and fuller at most times.<br>
    My head has became lighter and I have reduced the anxiety for random things around my days.<br>
    My thoughts has came back, and I have regain the ability to hold on to a thought at length and dig deep into it.<br>
    Maybe these was all placebo, but at least I had became happier with the time I spent.</p>
    <p>I thought that maybe I can find some explanation for the changes in my brain, so I went out and start reading The Shallows by Nicholas G. Carr.<br>
    In the book, the author went through the history of different major technologies and how each of them directly changes the “wiring” of our brains.<br>
    The tools we have been using, as the author said, has changed not only the way we do our tasks, but has altered the synapses and neurons in our brains at the anatomical level.<br>
    The more we use a certain tool, the more we practice the task of using them.<br>
    With more practices, our brain structure shifts to allow us to do that task more efficiently.<br>
    These shifts in our brain affect the way we think about other things too, besides from that task we were practicing by using the tools.<br>
    And the tools we have been using the most during these recent years, or in my case, the most of my life, is the Internet.<br>
    My thoughts were scattered all over the place, jumping from one matter to another in the span of seconds.<br>
    This way of thinking was not happening only in my downtime, but disturbingly, it was happening for the most of my “productive” time too.<br>
    I was fighting hard to focus, and the battles was not getting any easier if I have the Internet on.<br>
    Now I have come to a point where the constant context switching, the constant navigating, the scanning nature of using the Web is making me nausea and is putting me in a slightly panic mode.</p>
    <p>Maybe I’m actually just fine, and all of these symptoms are just because of me giving in too much about the book I have been reading that I’ve just mentioned above.<br>
    Or perhaps, as disturbingly as it sounds, I have had these feelings of using the Web since day one, but then I forgot about it as my brain altered and got used to this short-bursting way of thinking, instead of the focus, non-interrupted alternative.<br>
    For the time being, I will just connect to the Net to get my reading materials, then turn it off right when I got what I need.<br>
    I need to practice this behaviour because I can’t do anything while I’m connect to the distraction itself.</p>
